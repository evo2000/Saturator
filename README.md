# Saturator II

A wave-shaping device made with [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/). Use the exponential, clip, and sinusoidal parameters to design a transfer function, or draw one in with your mouse. Ableton Live users need only the `.amxd` file, the `.maxpat` file is a [Max 8](https://cycling74.com/products/max) patch which the device was based on.
