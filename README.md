## Installation

Ableton Live users need only the `.amxd` file. The `.maxpat` file is the Max 8 patch which the device was based on, included for curious Max users.

1. Open Ableton Live. In the browser sidebar, right click "User Library" -> "Show in Finder" (Mac) or "Show in Explorer" (Windows)
2. Follow this path and place file:
```
User Library/Presets/Audio Effects/Max Audio Effect/Saturator II.amxd
```
